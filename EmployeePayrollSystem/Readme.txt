 Just built a simple yet effective Payroll System using Java! ðŸ’»

As part of my journey to strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), 



I created a payroll management system that allows you to:

âœ… Add new employees(Full-Time or Intern)

âœ… Remove existing ones.

âœ… Display employee details like Name, ID, and Salary directly in the console





This hands-on project helped me apply key OOP principles such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Polymorphism in a practical way â€” something that goes beyond theory and brings real learning to life.

Hereâ€™s what I used:

 ðŸ”¹ Language: Java

 ðŸ”¹ Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, ArrayLists.

Itâ€™s a great foundation for building more complex systems in the future (like GUI-based or database-integrated versions). Always amazing to see how core concepts can power real solutions. ðŸ’¡

Would love to hear feedback from fellow developers or anyone working on similar projects!
